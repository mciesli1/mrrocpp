@defgroup IRP6OT_KINEMATICS Kinematics: The IRp-6 on track manipulator and its grippers.
@{
The group contains classes related to two main <b>software agents</b> of the IRp-6 on track manipulator.

The first part consideres different kinematic models of the manipulator itself:
 - \link mrrocpp::kinematics::irp6ot::model_with_wrist model_with_wrist\endlink model with active wrist and passive track DOFs, 
 - \link mrrocpp::kinematics::irp6ot::model_with_track model_with_track\endlink model with active track and passive wrist DOFs,
 - \link mrrocpp::kinematics::irp6ot::model_calibrated_with_wrist model_calibrated_with_wrist\endlink model with active wrist, 
 passive track DOFs and kinematic values computed during the calibration process. 

The other one contains kinematics of its grippers:
 - \link mrrocpp::kinematics::irp6ot_tfg::model tfg\endlink model of the two finger gripper,
 - \link mrrocpp::kinematics::bird_hand::kinematic_model_bird_hand bird_hand\endlink model ot the three finger gripper.
